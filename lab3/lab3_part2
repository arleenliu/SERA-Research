1. I was trying to show the trends of all the novel searches on one graph and compare them to one another. Since there were so many lines on the graph, I implemented a hover feature which displayed the exact data values at a particular point on the graph to show more detailed information. I also tried to implement a feature that could isolate certain lines in the graph to help users see something particular or focus on a certain aspect better, but I didnâ€™t have time to get it to work.
2. I graphed all the lines together on one graph to compare and show the similarities between the novel searches. I implemented the hover feature to enable users to extract more exact numbers and details from the same graph if they wanted to. I use a line graph to show the the changes of the trend over time.
