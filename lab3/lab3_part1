1. I chose the columns of the overall film search and the overall novel search.
2. Pearson's correlation coefficient was about 0.931 and the p-value was about 8.66*10^-115.
3. This correlation coefficient is valid because the lines of the graph match each other pretty closely, so the strong positive correlation coefficient seems reasonable.
4. I can draw a conclusion that the general film and novel searches had the closest matching pattern of searches of all the books, and the data has very little probability of error.
