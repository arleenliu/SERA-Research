Inner joins only take the values from the specified columns where each corresponding row has a value that is not null. Meanwhile, outer joins take every single value from both columns regardless of what the value of their corresponding row in the other table specified.
Some joins finish at different speeds because they have a different amount of values to print out, and the more values that get printed out, the more time it takes.
Outer joins are slower because they print out every single value, including additional columns, which will be more than the more selective inner join.
